Questlog 5 was the most difficult for me to get done, mainly based on the fact that I either forgot to hit the submit assignment after I hit the upload button.
I planned well, but mostly just due to forgetfullness wasn't able to get it in in time.
For the future, it's safer to submit the assignment as soon as I possibly can so that I don't forget about it.
Five Consequences:
    1. I didn't get credit for the assignment.
    2. I have all the work completed, but no points.
    3. I have to work harder now to make up for the lost points.
    4. I have to be more careful in the future.
    5. I have to allot more time to double check that I submitted everything correctly.
2 Long Lasting Systems to ensure this doesn't happen again:
    1. Upload the assignment immediately after finishing it.
    2. Set a reminder on my phone to double check that the assignment was submitted correctly.
